1)	In computer programming, a static variable is a variable that has been allocated "statically", 
2)	meaning that its lifetime (or "extent") is the entire run of the program. 
3)	This is in contrast to shorter-lived automatic variables, 
4)	whose storage is stack allocated and deallocated on the call stack;
5)	and in contrast to objects, whose storage is dynamically allocated and deallocated in heap memory.
6)	Variable lifetime is contrasted with scope (where a variable can be used): 
7)	"global" and "local" refer to scope, not lifetime, but scope often implies lifetime. 
8)	In many languages, global variables are always static, 
9)	but in some languages they are dynamic, while local variables are generally automatic, 
10)	but may be static.
